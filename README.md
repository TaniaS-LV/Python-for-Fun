# Language Learning Python Projects 

One of my hobbies is learning languages. After having learned 5 of them, I realized that some parts of the learning process can be automated and enhanced via programming languages such as Python. 

In this repo I'll publish some of my language learning related projects, such as: 

* A program for automated flashcard generation for a flashcard app using APIs. [See the details...](https://github.com/TaniaS-LV/Python-for-Fun/tree/main/flashcard_creation)
* A program for prioritizing new words and evaluating if they are worth learning at all :) [See the details...](https://github.com/TaniaS-LV/Python-for-Fun/tree/main/prioritizing_words) 
* My own flashcard learning app based on my ideas of how the process works best for me, etc.
